        <h1>Effects of Fires</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p class="ltr">Fires are one of the most destructive natural and human-made disasters. While fire is useful in daily life for cooking, heating, and energy production, uncontrolled fires can have devastating effects on people, property, the environment, and society as a whole. Understanding these effects is important to prevent fire accidents and reduce damage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. Effects on Human Health</h2>
            <p class="ltr">Fires pose serious risks to human health, sometimes causing life-long injuries or death.</p>

            <h3>a) Injuries and Burns</h3>
            <p class="ltr">Fires can cause burns of varying severity. Minor burns may heal with treatment, but severe burns can lead to permanent scars, disability, or even death.</p>

            <h3>b) Smoke Inhalation and Respiratory Problems</h3>
            <p class="ltr">Smoke from fires contains dangerous gases like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and toxic chemicals. Inhaling these gases can lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
                <li>Lung infections</li>
                <li>Long-term respiratory diseases</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="ltr">Children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing health conditions are especially vulnerable.</p>

            <h3>c) Deaths</h3>
            <p class="ltr">In large-scale fires, people may lose their lives due to being trapped, suffocation from smoke, or severe burns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. Effects on Property</h2>
            <p class="ltr">Fires can destroy homes, businesses, and public facilities, leading to huge economic losses.</p>

            <h3>a) Destruction of Buildings</h3>
            <p class="ltr">Residential houses, schools, hospitals, and factories may be completely burned down. Forest fires can spread to nearby villages, destroying homes and infrastructure.</p>

            <h3>b) Loss of Belongings</h3>
            <p class="ltr">Fires often destroy personal belongings such as furniture, clothing, important documents, and electronics. These losses can be devastating for families.</p>

            <h3>c) Economic Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost of rebuilding homes and public infrastructure</li>
                <li>Loss of business income due to damaged workplaces</li>
                <li>Increased insurance premiums</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Effects on the Environment</h2>
            <p class="ltr">Fires are not only dangerous to humans and property, but they also cause severe environmental damage.</p>

            <h3>a) Destruction of Forests and Wildlife</h3>
            <p class="ltr">Forest fires can destroy thousands of acres of trees, killing animals and birds that depend on the forest for survival. Many endangered species may be affected.</p>

            <h3>b) Air Pollution</h3>
            <p class="ltr">Fires release smoke, carbon monoxide, and other toxic gases into the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution that can affect areas far from the fire site.</p>

            <h3>c) Soil and Water Damage</h3>
            <p class="ltr">Intense heat from fires can burn nutrients in soil, reducing fertility and affecting plant growth. Ash and debris may contaminate rivers and lakes, harming aquatic life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Effects on Society</h2>
            <p class="ltr">Fires impact society as a whole, affecting communities, services, and daily life.</p>

            <h3>a) Displacement of People</h3>
            <p>People living in fire-affected areas may be forced to evacuate their homes and stay in temporary shelters, leading to overcrowding and health challenges.</p>

            <h3>b) Disruption of Services</h3>
            <p class="ltr">Fires can destroy roads, electricity, water supply, and communication systems, disrupting normal life and slowing rescue efforts.</p>

            <h3>c) Psychological and Emotional Effects</h3>
            <p class="ltr">Experiencing a fire can cause stress, anxiety, and trauma. Survivors may suffer from long-term psychological effects such as fear of future fires or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Long-Term and Global Effects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate Change Contribution:</strong> Fires release carbon dioxide, contributing to global warming.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Biodiversity:</strong> Repeated fires may lead to the extinction of plants and animals in affected areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Strain on Governments:</strong> Resources spent on firefighting, relief, and reconstruction can impact national budgets.</li>
            </ul>

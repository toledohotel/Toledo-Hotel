        <h2 class="ltr">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="ltr">Long ago, the ancient Greeks believed that fire was one of the basic elements of the universe. Many cultures also thought fire was special because it gives light, warmth, and power. Today, we know that fire is not a thing you can touch—it is a process.

Fire is a chemical reaction. When you see flames, you are watching a reaction happen, not an object. This same reaction happens slowly when a cut apple turns brown, metal rusts, or silver becomes dark. This process is called oxidation.

The difference between fire and these slow changes is speed. Fire happens very fast. Because of this, it gives off heat, light, and sometimes sound. Fire can become very hot and produces smoke.

Fire can be useful and dangerous. We use fire for cooking food, keeping warm, and making electricity. But if fire gets out of control, it can hurt people, destroy buildings, and harm nature.

Fire needs three things to burn: heat, fuel, and oxygen. This is called the Fire Triangle. If one of these things is removed, the fire will stop. Learning about fire helps us stay safe and prevent accidents.

<h3>Fire Triangle Components:</h3>
                <ul class="ltr">
                    <li>🔥Heat:A source of heat that raises the material to its ignition temperature.Examples: flame, electricity, sparks, hot   surfaces.</li>
                    <li>🪵Fuel:Any material that can burn examples: wood, paper, gasoline, plastic, gas.</li>
                    <li>🌬️Oxygen: Usually supplied by the air (about 21% oxygen).</li>
                    </ul>
<p class="ltr">In order to ignite a fire, it is necessary that all three components are present. The fire will continue to burn until one or more of the components are removed. The standard approach to fire extinguishing involves the removal of the fuel, heat or oxygen from the affected area.
In more recent years, a fourth component – the uninhibited chain reaction – has been added to explain fire. This chain reaction is the process by which heat is transferred to the fuel, resulting in the production of gaseous fuel that is utilised in the combustion process. In summary, the chain reaction is responsible for generating the heat required to sustain the fire. The inclusion of a fourth component, known as the "fire tetrahedron", provides a more precise representation of the mechanism employed by clean agent halon replacements to suppress fire. These replacements disrupt the uncontrolled chain reaction of combustion.</p>
